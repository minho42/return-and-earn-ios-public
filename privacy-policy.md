We will do our best to keep the data as accurate as possible.

Our app uses Google AdMob to display advertisements.
AdMob may collect certain information from your device, such as your device identifier, IP address, and usage data, to show you relevant ads.
This data may be shared with third-party partners for analytics and ad targeting purposes.
You can learn more about how Google collects and uses data by visiting their Privacy Policy.

Aside from data that may be collected through Google AdMob, we do not collect any other personal information from users, nor do we share your personal information with third parties.

It may be necessary for us to change this privacy policy without notice.
